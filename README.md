# lfc
A library of miscellaneous C utilities

## Overview
Consider `lfc` an extension of the C standard library to include the conveniences one might expect from a more modern language, like common data structures or more well-defined error handling, because that's pretty much what it feels like to write it. If you find yourself thinking that certain parts of the library look Rust-inspired (looking at you, panicking system), that's because they probably are.

## Installation & Use
TBD because I literally haven't gotten any infra set up yet

### Generics
uhhh how do these work

## Future
i'll do this later
