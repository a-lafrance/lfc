# Roadmap

## Collections
- [x] Vectors (array lists)
- [x] Owned strings (think Rust's `String` type, as an alternative to bare `char*` for string literals)
- [x] Hash maps
- [ ] Slicing
- [ ] Greater variety of linked lists (e.g. doubly-linked)
- [ ] Stacks
- [ ] Queues
- [ ] Tree-based sets
- [ ] Tree-based maps
- [ ] Heaps

## Other Ideas (may or may not ever materialize)
* Graphs and graph-related data structures & algorithms
* Concurrency primitives (e.g. mutexes, read-write locks, channels)
* Smart pointers (e.g. owned, reference-counted)
